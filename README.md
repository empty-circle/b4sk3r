Basker - The Reptilian Recon Buddy is a customized script that stealthily scans large IP blocks and investigates the services running on open ports.
This tool is excellent for conducting research across large swaths of the internet. The nmap commands for each stage are customized to provide a
decent balance between speed and stealth. It is designed to be unobtrusive and accurate, but it takes quite a long time.
